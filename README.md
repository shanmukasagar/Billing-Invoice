## Overview
The Billing, Invoicing, and Indent Management System is designed to streamline financial transactions by accurately tracking payables and receivables. It supports both purchase transactions (where amounts are payable to suppliers or vendors) and sales transactions (where amounts are receivable from customers or consumers). The system records critical details such as transaction date, time, product or service information, pricing, taxes (GST/VAT), and payment terms. It enables seamless invoice generation, ensuring proper documentation of billing and shipping addresses and installment plans. Additionally, it supports multiple payment methods, offering flexibility for both buyers and suppliers.
